This README file shows the basic setup needed to run Examinator.

See the Examinator documentation at 
http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Web+App+Reference+Implementation
for detailed instructions and the latest software versions.

NOTE: Scripts with extension .sh should be used with Linux or Cygwin.
      For Windows, use the equivalent .bat scripts.


----------------------------------
A. Run H2 Database server
----------------------------------

1. Start H2 database server
   cd <Examinator home directory>
   bin/h2db.sh start
   
2. Create the database "exam" (only need to run it once)
   bin/h2db.sh create-exam-db
   
Other operations:
  - You can stop H2 database server with
     bin/h2db.sh stop
  
  - Run H2 console and look at "exam" database
     bin/h2db.sh console
    
     Leave everything default but change "JDBC URL" to:
     jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/target/data/exam

----------------------------------
B. Install and set up Terracotta
----------------------------------

1. Download and install Terracotta 3.1.0

2. Download Terracotta Integration Modules (TIM):

   cd <Terracotta Installation Directory>
   bin/tim-get.sh install-for <examinator-install-dir>/tc-config.xml 

3. Start the Terracotta server instance:

   bin/start-tc-server.sh &

NOTE: You can stop the Terracotta server instance with:

   bin/stop-tc-server.sh

----------------------------------
C. Run the Examinator webapp
----------------------------------

1. Set the environment variable TC_INSTALL_DIR to your Terracotta installation directory.

In Linux:
   export TC_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/terracotta

In Cygwin:
   export TC_INSTALL_DIR=c:/path/to/terracotta

In a Windows CMD shell:
   set TC_INSTALL_DIR=c:/path/to/terracotta

2. From the Examinator home directory, start the two Jetty servers:

   bin/startCluster.sh

NOTE: Check console.log under work/8080/logs and work/8081/logs  
to make sure both Jetty instances finish starting up.
Jetty is running when you see this line in the log:

   INFO: Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080

3. To test, use a web browser to connect to Examinator on
   TCP port 8080 or 8081 of the Jetty servers.

a. Go to http://localhost:8080/examinator.

b. Log in as "student1" password "passwd1"

c. Start an exam and answer a few questions.

d. Go to http://localhost:8081/examinator.

e. Log in as the same student1 and take the same exam.
You should see the exam in progress. Questions already answered are still marked.

4. To stop the cluster:

   bin/stopCluster.sh

----------------------------------
D. Working with Jetty
----------------------------------
The following can be executed from the Examinator home directory.

To stop one instance of Jetty while allowing the other to continue running:

   bin/stopNode.sh [port]

where [port] is either 8080 or 8081.

To Start a single Jetty server with Terracotta disabled:

   bin/startNode.sh [port]

where [port] is either 8080 or 8081.

To Start a single Jetty server with Terracotta enabled:

   bin/startNode.sh [port] -tc

where [port] is either 8080 or 8081.
